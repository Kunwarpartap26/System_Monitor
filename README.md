# System_Monitor
System Monitor with Eel 💻 This Python script, system_monitor.py, creates a real-time system monitoring application using the Eel library, which embeds a web-based user interface (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) into a desktop application. It monitors and displays key system metrics such as CPU, RAM, disk usage, battery level, and network activity.
